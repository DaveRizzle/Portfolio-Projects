Data Project [Part 1]: SleepÂ Analysis

About two years ago I started collecting data about my sleep via a wearable that I purchased in early 2020.

I decided to get all the data I could from my wearable (not something that is easy to do) and turned my sorrowful sleep routine into a data science project.

What I found was pretty shocking and would ultimately lead to a diagnosis from my doctor that was very eye-opening!
