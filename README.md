Data Project [Part 1]: SleepÂ Analysis

I recently started collecting data about my sleep via a wearable that I purchased in 2020.

I knew that I was sleeping badly, but I didn't consider my sleep an impediment to my productivity or health. That wasn't until my hands and feet started aching.
At first, this wasn't really even noticeable. I put it down to training. I am in the habit of using 50mm grips and a climbing hangboard to increase my grip strength. I thought all of this was just post-workout soreness. Boy was I in for a surprise.
It wasn't until late in 2022 that I started waking up sore and in a lot more pain. That slowly escalated to a point where I was waking up 6 times a night because my body was aching so badly.
If you had asked, I would have responded with, "I'm fine!".

I decided to get all the data I could from my wearable (not something that is easy to do) and turned my sorrowful sleep routine into a data science project.

What I found was pretty shocking and would ultimately lead to a diagnosis from my doctor that was very eye-opening!
